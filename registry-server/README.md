# How to use this image
## Quick start
```s
    docker run -it -p 5000:5000 -p 8080:8080 jdelemar/registry-server /bin/sh
    # to start the Docker registry server and send it to the background
    # at the prompt type:
    registry serve /etc/docker/registry/config.yml & 
    # TODO: fix that - the docker-compose file does not have that issue
```

`docker-compose.yml`
```yml
    version: "3.1"

    services:
    registry-server:
        image: jdelemar/registry-server
        command: >
            sh -c "registry serve /etc/docker/registry/config.yml &
                tail -f /dev/null"
        ports:
        - 5000:5000
        - 8080:8080
```

The Docker registry will be available for connections at localhost:5000  
*Note: No browser response on port 5000*

Type `http-server` or `hs` to browse/download files from the container at http://localhost:8080

## Putting images in this registry  
```s
    REGISTRY="localhost:5000"
    IMAGE="jdelemar/registry-server:latest"
    docker pull $IMAGE
    docker tag $IMAGE $REGISTRY/$IMAGE
    docker push $REGISTRY/$IMAGE
```
